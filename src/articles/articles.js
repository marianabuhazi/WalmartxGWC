export const articles = [`I am not kidding when I say I saw the posting for this competition 1 day before the deadline. Regardless of the time crunch,
I immediately knew I had to 
come up with a submission idea. After some thinking I settled on what has become my vision for: "Walmart Rooms". Now keep in mind,
that this idea is still in its very early stages but I consider that it has the potential to make Walmart outrun its Home and Furnishing store competitors.
During my brainstorming session, I happened to remember that my mother had just purchased a night table for her room earlier this week. 
I had seen her look through Walmart.com for days searching for the perfect one, and pulling out measuring tape to determine
the distance between the wall in her room and her bed, to fit this night table. She finally found it, ordered it,
received it and when she assembled it, she found it would not fit where she wanted it to. She whined and whined about how she measured it
so many times, and that it had to be Walmart's fault in mismeasuring (and definitely not hers!).`,
`This got me thinking about how I wished the site had an option that allowed you to see in a 3D room model, how your items would look, so that you could ensure 
it fits as desired and looks just the same. Additionally, I wish that Walmart had an option to keep a registry/inventory of items I want to buy for
my room and that it could show me how others have used these same items to decorate their own rooms. Similar to a forum or a Pinterest board,
I could then shop Walmart items from other customers' 3D room models, making the shopping experience so much more fun and interactive
for returning customers. On the right, and in the demo at the bottom of this page, you may see my idea for this interactive
shopping space Walmart could implement. This mockup shows a black kitchen stool I searched for on the Walmart app and how after I add
it to My Room, it would show me how others have styled their kitchens with the same or similar stool.`, 
`Then, I thought about all the ways this could be implemented and how exactly customers could access this tool. 
This led me to realize that this feature would only be available on the Walmart App and therefore only to users whose
cellphones have a camera access. As a source of inspiration for development I looked to the Measure app created by Apple. This 
application allows you to scale objects in your proximity and it happens to be extremely accurate. I figured this same concept
could be applied to Walmart Rooms.`, `After clicking on an item in the Walmart Home Department, customers would be shown
a "Add to Room" button in addition to the existing "Add to Cart". "Add to Room" would ask them to either select an existing 3D Room model, or
create one. The "Create a Room" option would ask the user for Camera permission and allow them to scan the room, with a movement
similar to taking a panoramic image, and then allow for processing. The process would be quick enough to get the user's 
attention and keep them shopping on the site. After the model is created, the user could then drag in items to their Room, view 
them up close, shop, and post them to the Walmart Rooms board for other customers to shop from. See the gif to the right
as a demonstration of how the scanning process could work.`,
`I thought Walmart Rooms would be a perfect addition to the Walmart App given the recent news that Walmart plans to 
acquire Zeekit, a tool that would create a new virtual try-on experience for shoppers. Considering that Walmart is more
than just a clothing store, but a department store, I felt that this idea could be extended to all store departments
starting with Home and Appliances. In the future, it would be fantastic to see how Walmart uses Augmented Reality
to continue to reinvent their online shopping experience.`,`The truth is that the future is uncertain. We have spent the past year quarantining
and social distancing to protect ourselves from COVID-19. Throughout a time of much self-reflection, we came out with the biggest conclusion
 of all:
that human connection is of upmost importance and that technology is an essential tool in bringing us together. Regardless, of 
whether you consider that Walmart Rooms is or isn't going to appeal to Walmart customers right now, one thing is certain- that this concept
will be implemented by all Furniture stores in a few years. Now ask yourself whether you would want to pass up such an opportunity to the competition.`,
`Hi! My name is Marian Abuhazi (she/hers 19) and I am the creator or this beautiful idea and site.

where I study Computer Science. I am also a former Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program
scholar and current Virtual SIP and Club Teacher.`,
`I was born in Caracas, Venezuela and raised in Miami, FL after the political and economic crisis in my country
forced my family to seek asylum in America. Growing up in a low-income immigrant 
household of 17, and raised by a single mother, my whole life has been about tackling financial challenges. My family
has always counted on Walmart's affordable yet stylish home furnishing and appliances to meet our every day living 
necessities. I find Walmart to be a corporation that truly cares about their community, their customers and the environment, 
and for this reason I felt motivated to create for you my vision of the future of Walmart.com.
WalmartxGWC was an opportunity I could not pass. I hope you enjoy my site.
